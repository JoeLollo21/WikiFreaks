# WikiFreaks Licensing Information:
Due to the public-access nature of this protocol’s intake data, with all datasets sourced from en.Wikipedia.org, WikiFreaks has decided to attach the **Creative Commons "No Rights Reserved"** public domain license, widely known as **CC0**. However, the Wikimedia Foundation itself uses the "Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License" for all internal articles and other text uploaded onto the site. This license ensures that text which is borrowed or modified must retain its original CC BY-SA 3.0 license to be shared, and that proper attribution must be given to the original source material. 
<br><br>
Wikipedia’s [Copyright FAQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:FAQ/Copyright#:~:text=Facts%20cannot%20be%20copyrighted.,be%20your%20own%20original%20creation.), part of their greater FAQ page, states that **CC0 "No Rights Reserved"** licenses are the only Wikipedia-compatible Creative Commons license without author attribution required. As WikiFreaks is built on Top25 Reports with many authors, a CC0 license is more sensible, because proper curator credit will be provided in metadata and in the .README markdown file of our GitHub repository instead. 
<br><br>
The WikiFreaks protocol will not make exceptions for this project, as all of our data must be public-access and will be CC0 “No Rights Reserved” licensed, but every deposited dataset must also be vetted by WikiFreaks’ team of curators before it is accepted into our repository.
