# Introduction
## Statement of Work:
Over the past 22 years, Wikipedia has proven to be an important place of sociocultural reference, as well as a locus of casual research for global netizens. Not just a “free encyclopedia,” Wikipedia provides readers with a snapshot of human interest over time through its collected Internet traffic, where views, edit counts, and search hints reveal the public’s information trends in a given year.
<br><br>
WikiFreaks is an open repository capturing a 20+ year history of Internet culture in broad strokes, featuring data regarding user traffic on the English Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org). Some data points of particular interest include Wikipedia’s Top 25 Reports, which are weekly, monthly, and annual , as well as the knowledge representation of these pages on the WikiData project.
<br><br>
For the purposes of this project, the WikiFreaks repository will align Wikipedia pages with WikiData’s unique identifiers and taxonomic classification, namely through [instance-class relationships](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P31). The cataloging and integration of this data can provide our users with a rare yet comprehensive glimpse into our generation’s Internet-driven culture, and the way that they organize and value information.

## Repository Goals:
To assist researchers in analyzing and documenting the history of English-speaking Internet culture, the WikiFreaks repository aims to:
- Provide a central repository for data related to user engagement with the Wikimedia Foundation’s websites.
- Establish data collection standards that allow for Wikipedia data to be discovered and completed.
- Allow users to freely upload and download data in compliance with our policies.
