# WikiFreaks User Community:
Unlike a typical repository for cultural heritage data, WikiFreaks inspects the history of digital culture—we aim to catalog the top Wikipedia pages accessed by English-speaking Internet users, to identify which broader topics and discourses have defined Internet citizenship.
<br><br>
Our data will be of value to the following prospective users:
<br><br>
**Wikipedia administrators and users:**
<br>
Members of the community whose histories are documented are direct stakeholders in the development of digital culture, and would likely be interested in having an easy directory of historical data surveying the site. Wikipedia administrators, who supervise specific projects and pages on the site, may also be interested in having an easy reference to multiple forms of authority control found in our data, such as the WikiData identifiers.
<br><br>
**Digital humanities researchers, particularly in digital history and cultural studies:**
<br>
Humanities researchers may refer to our results as a point of reference for understanding smaller trends in Internet discourse, and could compare our findings alongside sociopolitical or historic happenings to understand how web culture is being actively shaped by the real world.
<br><br>
**Social scientists researching the Internet, particularly through computational or mixed methods:**
<br>
The WikiFreaks repository features tabular data indicative of cultural activity online. Since our results will be both quantitative and qualitative, they are highly accessible to researchers in the field of social science, who are searching for a broader cultural context in which to strengthen their hypotheses.
<br><br>
**Data journalists:**
<br>
Due to the human-centered nature of our data, data journalists might use our repository as a means of creating appealing stories, as well as identifying trends and themes among Wikipedia searches which demonstrate interest in reading about a given subject, honing their product towards what is most digestible and desired by the public.

## User Stories:
User stories can help capture what our various user communities and stakeholders would want to accomplish with our data. These stories will guide our data documentation process and policies, repository features, and curation efforts, setting the tone for what our repository is going to look like.
