1,"BlackPanther(film)",,"3,426,528",,"Wakanda forever! Two years after hisfilm debut in Captain America: Civil War,King T'Challa stars in a compelling,provocative and entertaining solo filmthat is one of the most African moviesever, even if it was made by a filmmakerfrom Oakland (#23). Along with muchcritical praise, Black Panther is alsowrecking up box office records, grossing$700 million in less than two weeks."
2,"SylvesterStallone",,"2,748,618",,"As if shock death reports aren't enough,sometimes the internet decides to killfamous people before their time. Thelatest victim of such a thing wasStallone, with a rumor that he had died ofcancer driving readers to his page, buthe was thankfully alive to call out on the""stupidity"" (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/02/20/sylvester-stallone-is-not-dead-at-least-thats-what-he-says/?utm_term=.dba13caa6c16). In the meantime, he prepares toreturn as Rocky Balboa in the sequel forCreed, whose director (#23) and mainactor (#5) received Sly's compliments (https://www.instagram.com/p/Bfb15bTDxxU/) for their work in Black Panther (#1)."
3,"BillyGraham",,"1,662,485",,"""The only boy who could ever teach me,was the son of a preacher man.""Graham is arguably the second mostinfluential preacher of recent memory,and over the span of his 99-year longearthly career, he used his pulpit todeliver sermon and speech to billions ofadherents. While many may not haveagreed with his biblical interpretations,Graham's massive impact is undeniable,as he managed to become a close aidefor multiple presidents, and a strongsupporter of the Civil Rights Movement.Christianity lost one on its bastions thisweek, and curious Wikipedians journeyedto parse the page of the evangelist, wholed his congregation in some slightly lessviolent crusades..."
4,"2018WinterOlympics",,"1,264,289",,"Both writers here aren't much interestedin the Winter Games - one's countrynever does well in winter sports, theother's nation barely has snow - but can'tdeny this year's events had some funmoments. And being in South Korea, itserves as preparation for how the 2020Summer Olympics will force sports fansto live in the Japan Standard Time."
5,Michael B. Jordan,,"1,196,642",," As the proverb goes, ""if at first you don't succeed, try, try again"" - this saying is more directly applicable to Jordan than most. Nowadays, all Hollywood mainstays (apart from Leo), harbor heroic aspirations, and tie their colors to the mast of one of the superhero universes. However, after Jordan's first effort ended
in abject failure, he got a second swing
at it, portraying Erik Kilmonger (#25) in
the zeitgeist-capturing Black Panther
(#1). One would be foolish to question
his acting credentials, even if he is
doomed to be the other Michael Jordan
for perpetuity."
6,Exo (band),,"1,175,866",,"Another entry from the snowy utopia ofPyeongchang now, though a less directone. Exo are a very popular K-pop group,but they have not yet seeped intoWestern culture like some of their peers.However, after performing at the closingceremony in dramatic and entertainingfashion, they have hit the headlines inthe West. Perhaps they can cross thePacific and become superstarsstateside. I may not have too much of anaffinity for their lyrics, but their musiccannot be worse than the supposedperfection of current compositions"
7,"ChadwickBoseman",,"1,000,935",,"A truly excellent actor, Boseman portraysthe titular King T'Challa in Black Panther(#1), donning the costume he first tookon in Captain America: Civil War onceagain. Despite the presence of amassive number of burgeoning andtalented black actors appearing in thefilm, Boseman still shines above andbeyond as he delivers a captivating andnuanced performance."
8,"LindseyVonn",,"982,028",,"American alpine skier Vonn got a bronzein the downhill, a reminder that she's stilla good athlete in spite of the controversyshe raised following negative commentsregarding President Donald Trump, whicheven led some enraged people online tobrand Vonn as anti-American (https://www.bbc.com/sport/winter-olympics/43102838) and root for her failure. I feel that thisis anti-thetical to the Olympic spiritmyself, and should be unequivocallycondemned."
9,"TessaVirtue",,"930,176",,"The Canadian figure skater is part of adynamic duo with Scott Moir (#16), whocompeted, with golden success, inPyeongchang. However, this is not thereason why her figures have beenpropelled upwards. Rather, following aperformance best characterised assteamy (http://time.com/5157649/tessa-virtue-scott-moir-valentines-day/) on St.Valentine's Day, the internet becameconvinced that the duo were in love,despite their insistence to the contrary.So, it appears, the highly successfulskaters are merely platonic friends, andtheir relationship is professional ratherthan amorous. Eh, still a better lovestory than Twilight."
10,Curling,,"615,273",,"The Winter Olympics are not asinteresting as the Summer ones,specially when offered speed (sledding,hockey), dangerous stunts (skiing andsnowboarding), and beauty (figureskating), the broadcasters dedicate somuch time to curling, this sport revolvingaround throwing rocks and sweeping icethat was ripe for a song parody (https://youtube.com/watch?v=vqrBRjyNyDA?t=57s)."
11,"BlackPanther(comics)",,"754,040",,"T'Challa is the king of the fictionalWakanda, and as such controls vastswathes of vibranium. The metal,blended as an alloy with adamantium toform Captain America's shield, is worthtitanic amounts of money according toMarvel canon. Thanks to the filmadaptation of the character (#1), wherehe is portrayed by Chadwick Boseman(#7), Marvel Studios could take all of themetal off his hands, and have somechange left over after the transaction (http://money.cnn.com/2018/02/18/media/black-panther-box-office/index.html)."
12,"Deaths in2018",,"635,086",,"Death is omnipresent, and curiosity forthe morbid is a guarantee amongstpurveyors of Wikipedia, thus parachutingthis list of the fallen into each and everyiteration of the Report. This week'scongregation is led, rather fittingly, byBilly Graham. (#3)"
13,"StevenHolcomb",,"610,934",,"Last week we had a disgraced formerWinter Olympian in Tonya Harding. Thisweek is a deceased one, a bobsledderwhose death in the U.S. OlympicTraining Center last year was still beingfelt by his teammates: they worebracelets with Holcomb's nickname""Night Train"" and brought his mother tosupport them in South Korea (https://www.sltrib.com/sports/2018/02/23/steve-holcombs-mom-is-in-pyeongchang-to-root-for-the-us-bobsled-team-her-late-son-would-have-led/)."
14,Dua Lipa,,"610,934",,"Dua Lipa is the latest sensation on the music scene, with musicphiles the world over embracing her new rules. She has been propelled into the report this week due to the Brit Awards, where she won bigly. Her live performance (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHtnxluMXMw) garnered criticism in some quarters, with accusations of a lack of stage presence being levied at her. However, having bagged four awards, I'm sure that she does not give a f**k."
15,"JohnnyWeir",,"609,659",,"Weir, a former figure skater, is part of aduo with Tara Lipinski on NBC, coveringthe Winter Olympics. The LGBTQactivist engages audiences daily bycommenting on events over inPyeongchang, and this is drawing manyinternet users to his article. I can't saythat I find the sport too intriguing, buttheir shared commentary is riveting andhumorous (http://time.com/5164019/winter-olympics-figure-skater-game-of-thrones/), perhaps accounting for theirpopularity."
16,Scott Moir,,"584,347",,"How can you tell if a person cannot bediscussed without bringing up someoneelse? In Moir's case, just look at ourimages of him on Commons: all of themalso have Tessa Virtue (#9). No wonderthey both work really well together - theirgold in the 2010 Olympics, pictured tothe left, is now joined by two others in2018 - and have fans wondering if they'rea couple."
17,"TaraLipinski",,"551,687",,"The former figure skater and Olympicchampion is part of NBC's analysis panelfor the Winter Olympics (#3) alongsideher co-anchor, Johnny Weir (#15).Perhaps her ubiquity on the Peacocknetwork has propelled her figures onWikipedia upwards, as has her sharpcritiques of the skaters. Living outside ofthe US, I cannot say that I am toofamiliar with Lipinski and her credentialsto analyse the Winter Olympics, but thelast syllable of her surname is irrefutablyapt."
18,"StonemanDouglasHighSchoolshooting",,"572,136",,"Last week, I discussed the need, theabsolute and irrefutable prerogative, toimplement legislation to curb firearmsuse in the United States of America.However, it has become apparent to methat such advice will not be heeded, andto repeat it is redundant. The blood of the17 victims is barely even dry, and theirschoolmates and colleagues are doingevery thing in their power to ensure thattheir loss is not futile - even if they arebranded as actors (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-43140105) bysome deplorable individuals. The grandold solution to this predicament - let'sarm the teachers, and turn schools into alive playthrough of a COD game. Morechildren will die. This does notelsewhere. But, sure, what is the cost ofdead kids when you get to hang on to aAR-15 in case the government goesrogue and you need it to stop them?"
19,Steller's sea cow,,"564,342",,"Having been somewhat quiet in recent iterations of the report, the eminently intellectual subreddit that is r/TIL (https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/7ydnv4/til_there_were_30ft_long_sea_cows_called_stellers/) strikes back.
Without them, this list would be
significantly less diverse and
entertaining. This is a particularly
intriguing entry, focusing on a massive
extinct dugong. Good to see a Featured
Article attracting attention as well."
20,"ColumbineHighSchoolmassacre",,"550,392",,"Perhaps the most infamous of the many,many, many school shootings stateside,the Columbine massacre makes it wayon top of the list again. Eric Harris andDylan Klebold killed 13 people and thenthemselves. Up until the Florida shooting(#18), it was the worst massacre tooccur at a high school. Columbineoccurred in the 1990s, before 9/11, andreminded the USA of the heinous evilwhich can manifest itself, and affectedthe culture of the era to a large extentaccordingly. Not enough to changeanything, though."
21,"Perpetualstew",,"547,204",,"Another Reddit contribution (https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/7z4n7j/til_about_perpetual_stew_common_in_the_middle/), as someone learnedabout this collaborative culinaryconcoction, where the pot is neveremptied as people keep adding newingredients and liquid. Wonder if any ofthose stews started with a stone."
22,"LetitiaWright",,"540,218",,"This week's report concludes with aWakandan quartet, with all four itemsrelated directly to the riveting andriotously successful box office behemoththat tops this list. Highest placed,understandably, is the most obscure ofthe bunch - Letitia Wright, who portraysT'Challa's sister in the film. This is abreakthrough role for the British actor,building upon a rigid foundation laid byCharlie Brooker. She was captivating inthat part, and is clever and charming asShuri."
23,Ryan Coogler,,"518,075",,"Next up, we have the director of the watercooler work, Ryan Coogler. He previously made the astounding Fruitvale Station and subsequently turned what should have been a routine franchise release into one of the best films of 2015. It is of little surprise to cinephiles, therefore, that even within the rigid confines of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, he produced a sublime superhero film. Coogler has an exceptionally bright future ahead of him, with the opportunity to become a seminal African-American diretor, a subset which Hollywood has traditionally neglected (https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/race-barriers-battling-nerves-a-candid-conversation-oscars-4-african-american-directing-nominees-90-1087644)."
24,"LupitaNyong'o",,"509,620",,"Next up is Lupita Nyong'o, one of themost highly regarded black actressescurrently working in film. Having baggeda (well deserved) Oscar for 12 Years aSlave, and appearing in one of the mostmemorable photos of the decade (https://twitter.com/TheEllenShow/status/440322224407314432/photo/1), Nyong'o hasmoved on to franchise fare, initiallyappearing as Maz Kanata in every nerd'ssecond favourite space themedfranchise, and now as Nakia in BlackPanther. While playing the stereotypicallove interest role, Nyong'o's character isdriven, dogged, and determined -qualities that the actress herself willrequire if her new ambition (https://qz.com/1214091/lupita-nyongo-brings-trevor-noahs-south-african-story-to-hollywood/) isto succeed."
25,Erik Kilmonger,,"505,368",,"As we began this report with Black Panther in the ascendancy, it is only fitting that we conclude with its antagonist. Portrayed by Michael B. Jordan, and adorned in a fierce tribal mask, Kilmonger spends the film on a crusade, determined to use the advanced technology of Wakanda to liberate his American bretheren. However, while this pursuit may perhaps curry favor and support amongst a cinematic audience, Kilmonger is far too ruthless and repugnant an individual to endorse over T'Challa. He attempts to usurp the crown, and anarchic chaos ensues. I shan't continue with this synopsis any longer, but suffice it to say that the film was very entertaining - anyone on the fence should join the masses (http://www.boxofficemojo.com.movies/?id=marvel2017b.htm) and watch it, as you are unlikely to be disappointed."
