# Sample Data Index:
This is a repository of sample Wikipedia data that was gathered by mixing Top 25 Reports with WikiData identifiers.

## Proof of Conversion and Curation of Data:
Within the ["sample-data" directory](https://github.com/JoeLollo21/WikiFreaks/tree/main/sample-data), the ["Raw-Data"](https://github.com/JoeLollo21/WikiFreaks/tree/main/sample-data/Raw-Data) folder features raw data from five Top 25 reports on Wikipedia, before any authority control and data-cleaning were added to it.
<br><br>
The data was gathered, and later modified for long-term management, through the following process:
<ul>
  <li>Saving multiple Top 25 Report pages as PDFs.</li>
  <li>Using <strong>Tabula</strong> (<a href="https://tabula.technology/">"https://tabula.technology/"</a>) to convert the tables to CSV formats.</li>
  <li>Cleaned for readability and given extra values using <strong>OpenRefine</strong> (<a href="https://openrefine.org/">https://openrefine.org/</a>).</li>
</ul>

## Documentation:
A [data dictionary]() was created to help end-users understand what each of the data points, and their sources, are.
